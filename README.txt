Description
-----------

This is a small script that I use when I plug my laptop to my TV with
an HDMI cable; I want the video output to be extended to the TV as a
second monitor and the sound to come out of my TV.  Doing this
manually with graphical configuration utilities for randr and
pulseaudio was easy, but a bit slow.  This script automates the
process of enabling/disabling HDMI AV output.
